# null

Just a nice little set of structs to ease the marshalling and unmarshalling of types that need to play well with nullable types in Postgres. They embed null types from the [database/sql](https://pkg.go.dev/database/sql) package. This is not an exhaustive set of nullable types, which will be added as they are needed.
